      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an accounts payable coordinator at a telecommunications company looking to make a change in my life. I don't know if coding is the be all, end all, but I'm excited to learn a new skill and see what the coding world has to offer!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Irvine, California but moved around the country pretty consistently throughout my childhood.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to write, play video games, and draw.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm up for anything as long as it's a comfortable environment with good people.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Franklin Park, NJ</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have been on the internet since I was a child. I started taking coding classes in high school and really enjoyed it as a part time hobby. I've used my basic understanding to personalize my social media presence but would really love to dive in deeper and learn how to do more advanced things. I'm hoping I can take this skill that I've found enjoyable and monetize it into employment.</p>
